Meaning: 
Polite and indirect way of suggestion or advice for someone to do something.
It softens the advice, making it sound like a command and more like a gentle recommendation for their benefit.

Example: 
- You might want to take an umbrella, as it looks like rain.
- You might want to save your work before closing the program.
- You might want to check the expiration date before you buy that milk.
